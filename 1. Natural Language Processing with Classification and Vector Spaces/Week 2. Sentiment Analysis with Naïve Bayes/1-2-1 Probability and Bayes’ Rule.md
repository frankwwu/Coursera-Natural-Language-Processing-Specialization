To calculate a probability of a certain event happening, you take the count of that specific event and you divide by the sum of all events. Furthermore, the sum of all probabilities has to equal 1.

To compute the probability of 2 events happening, like "happy" and "positive" in the picture above, you would be looking at the intersection, or overlap of events. In this case red and blue boxes overlap in 3 boxes. So the answer is \frac{3}{20}.
