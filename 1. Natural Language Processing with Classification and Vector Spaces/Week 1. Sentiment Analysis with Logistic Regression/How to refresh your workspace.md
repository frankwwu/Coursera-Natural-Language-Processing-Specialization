# How to refresh your workspace

There may come a time when you want to refresh your workspace to get the most updated version of the starter code.  This may be the case if you wish to start over, or if the deeplearning.ai team has provided an update with bug fixes or enhancements.  To refresh your workspace, please follow these steps:

* In any Jupyter notebook, first, save your work by going clicking File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)
* Next, click File -> Open. This opens up the file directory.
* Select the notebook you wish to refresh from the list by clicking the checkbox next to the filename
* Click the trashcan icon at the top to delete the notebook
* Copy this text: ?forceRefresh=true and paste it onto the end of the URL in your browser bar then hit <Enter>.
* You will see your workspace refresh with the updated copy of the notebook
