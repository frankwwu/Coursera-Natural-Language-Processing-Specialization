# Application of RNNs

RNNs could be used in a variety of tasks ranging from machine translation to caption generation. There are many ways to implement an RNN model:

* One to One: given some scores of a championship, you can predict the winner. 
* One to Many: given an image, you can predict what the caption is going to be.
* Many to One: given a tweet, you can predict the sentiment of that tweet. 
* Many to Many: given an english sentence, you can translate it to its German equivalent. 

In the next video, you will see the math in simple RNNs.
