# Overview

You use auto-correct everyday. When you send your friend a text message, or when you make a mistake in a query, there is an autocorrect behind the scenes that corrects the sentence for you. This week you are also going to learn about minimum edit distance, which tells you the minimum amount of edits to change one word into another. In doing that, you will learn about dynamic programming which is an important programming concept which frequently comes up in interviews and could be used to solve a lot of optimization problems.
