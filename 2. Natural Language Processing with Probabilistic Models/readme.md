# 2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

## What you'll learn

Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to implement autocorrect, autocomplete & identify part-of-speech tags for words.

## Skills you'll gain

* Word2vec
* Parts-of-Speech Tagging
* N-gram Language Models
* Autocorrect

## Build your subject-matter expertise

This course is part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing Specialization
When you enroll in this course, you'll also be enrolled in this Specialization.
* Learn new concepts from industry experts
* Gain a foundational understanding of a subject or tool
* Develop job-relevant skills with hands-on projects
* Earn a shareable career certificate

## There are 4 modules in this course

In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
b) Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is vital for computational linguistics,
c) Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and 
d) Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
