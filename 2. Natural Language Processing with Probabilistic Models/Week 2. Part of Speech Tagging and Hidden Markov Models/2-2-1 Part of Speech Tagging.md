# Part of Speech Tagging

Part of Speech Tagging (POS) is the process of assigning a part of speech to a word. By doing so, you will learn the following: 

* Markov Chains
* Hidden Markov Models
* Viterbi algorithm

Here is a concrete example:

You can use part of speech tagging for: 

* Identifying named entities
* Speech recognition
* Coreference Resolution

 You can use the probabilities of POS tags happening near one another to come up with the most reasonable output.
