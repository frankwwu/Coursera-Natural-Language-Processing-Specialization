# Overview

Word embeddings are used in most NLP applications. Whenever you are dealing with text, you first have to find a way to encode the words as numbers. Word embedding are a very common technique that allows you to do so. Here are a few applications of word embeddings that you should be able to implement by the time you complete the specialization.

By the end of this week you will be able to: 

* Identify the key concepts of word representations
* Generate word embeddings
* Prepare text for machine learning
* Implement the continuous bag-of-words model
