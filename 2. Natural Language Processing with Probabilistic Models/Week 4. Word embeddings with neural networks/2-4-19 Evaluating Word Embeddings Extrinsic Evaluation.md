# Evaluating Word Embeddings: Extrinsic Evaluation

**Extrinsic evaluation** tests word embeddings on external tasks like named entity recognition, parts-of-speech tagging, etc. 

* Evaluates actual usefulness of embeddings
* Time Consuming
* More difficult to trouble shoot

So now you know both **intrinsic** and **extrinsic** evaluation.
